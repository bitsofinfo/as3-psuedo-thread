# as3-psuedo-thread
AS3 pseudo threading utility

Moved here from Google Code.

PseudoThread is a class which can give your Actionscript and Flex apps "thread-like" behavior. 
PseudoThread processes IRunnables which is where you implement the work you want done by a "thread". 
This light-weight and extremely tiny framework is easy to use and understand. 

This code was eventually rolled into the [AS3 Commons Project](https://code.google.com/p/as3-commons/)
